    "## Overall requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "For your semester project, I will be looking both at your repo, and in particular at the introduction/explanation jupyter notebook you created for the last checkpoint and will expand for this final checkpoint. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Jupyter notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "The jupyter notebook should include both: \n",
    "\n",
    "* Code cells running scripts from your package.  Note this should *not* include new code, this notebook is meant to be an explanation of what your code does for someone else to use it. \n",
    "* Narrative text (using Markdown cells) that explains what you did, why you did it, and how you went about it. This may not apply to every project, but one way to break the notebook up into the following meaningful sections so that the instructor can follow the logical flow of your work. Note that you may deviate from this organization if it fits your particular project better.\n",
    "\t- **Background and Motivation** (Provide some context for the problem and what question(s) you set out to answer.)\n",
    "\t- **Methodology** (How did you go about answering your question(s)? Most of your example code will be contained in this section.)\n",
    "\t- **Results** (What did you find when you carried out your methods? Some of your code related to presenting results/figures/data may be replicated from the methods section or may only be present in this section.  All of the plots that you plan on using for your presentation should be present in this section)\n",
    "\t- **Synthesis and Discussion** (What did you learn from your results? What obstacles did you run into? What would you do differently next time? What is the answer to your question(s) and why?)\n",
    "\n",
    "**The code, text, and visuals should be threaded together as coherent report of your work!**\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the notebook, you will be giving a **10 minute** presentation using a short set of slides to share the results of your project with your fellow classmates and your instructors. Your presentation should include appropriate **visual aids**. Your presentation should address:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The **background** required to understand the material\n",
    "* The **capabilities** of your code and what users might be interested in using it.\n",
    "* The **computational techniques** that you incorporated into your code.\n",
    "* The **conclusions** you can draw from your code/analysis/experiements/models.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Presentation slides\n",
    "\n",
    "You can create your slides using any medium, but please ensure that the instructor and TA have access after the fact.  You should aim for having a reasonable number of slides -- a good rule of thumb is ~1 min of time per slide. For a presentation of this length, you probably wouldn't want to have more than 10-12 slides, but you should make sure that you have a sufficient number of slides to support your presentation. You should make sure that you will be able to present your slides using the classroom A/V system or via zoom.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The slides should**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Address the above points in a logical order.\n",
    "* Include a title slide with your project title, name, and course number.\n",
    "* Effectively communicate information through a combination of text and figures. Text and figures should be legible (even for someone far from the presentation screen!).\n",
    "* Only include text and figures that support the presentation (avoid including content \"just because\").\n",
    "* Avoid large paragraphs of text, use bullet points instead.\n",

    "## Grading Rubric\n",
    "\n",
    "The presentation/project will be graded as follows. Please note that everything is graded on a 4.0 scale. \n",
    "\n",
    "* One quarter of the grade (**25%**) comes from the oral presentation. Is it clear and well-structured? Does the student effectively communicate the key ideas about their results?\n",
    "\t* *Excellent presentation*: student speaks clearly and in a logical manner, and makes their key points clear. They use eye contact and minimally use notes. (**4.0**)\n",
    "\t* *Good presentation*: student speaks clearly and logically and conveys key points, but presentation is somewhat lacking (heavy use of notes; moderate eye contact, etc.) (**3.5**)\n",
    "\t* *Fair presentation*: student's oral presentation is substantially lacking: little eye contact, speaking too quietly to be heard or with little inflection, clarity/logical flow in speaking is sub-par, etc. (**3.0**)\n",
    "\t* *Poor presentation*: student's oral presentation is completely lacking: little to no eye contact, cannot be heard, there is no logical progression to the presentation. (**2.5**)\n",
    "    * *Does not present*: (**0**)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* One quarter of the grade (**25%**) comes from the student's slides. Do the slides complement their oral presentation, and conform to the guidelines?\n",
    "\t* *Excellent slides*: Slides are useful, and aid in understanding of the conent. Not too many (forcing the presenter to rush) or too few (resulting in a very short talk). Slides are well organized, and legible. Slides complement oral presentation. (**4.0**)\n",
    "\t* *Good slides*: Slides deviate from specifications in some minor way: too many or too few slides, not all points addressed, some slides hard to understand (poor graphics, too much or too little text, etc.) (**3.5**)\n",
    "\t* *Fair slides*: Slides deviate from specifications in some substantial way: too many or too few slides, half or fewer of points addressed, most slides hard to understand (poor graphics, too much or too little text, etc.) (**3.0**)\n",
    "\t* *Poor slides*: Slides do not conform to specifications in any meaningful way. (**2.5**)\n",
    "    * *Does not present*: (**0**)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* One quarter of the grade (**25%**) comes from the the content in the student's repository. \n",
    "\n",
    "    * The main things I'm looking for are:\n",
    "\n",
    "        - Working, well organized code (this includes not having leftover files pushed to your repo, naming conventions understandable\n",
    "        - Working, useful auto-documentation that makes it easy for a new user to get started with your code.\n",
    "        - Working test functions (note it's possible that your code might still *fail* test functions since you might have built test functions for some future intention). \n",
    "    * For each of these points, the grading is as follows\n",
    "        * *Excellent content*: All pieces clearly included and functioning. (**4.0**)\n",
    "        * *Good content*: Most of the requirements pieces functioning, or all functioning but some are unclear. (**3.5**)\n",
    "        * *Fair content*: Roughly half of the points clearly and concisely addressed, or all points nominally addressed but half are unclear.(**3.0**)\n",
    "        * *Poor content*: Few of the points clearly and concisely addressed, or most/all points nominally answered but most are unclear. (**2.5**)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "* The last quarter of the grade (**25%**) comes from the content in introduction jupyter notebook in the students' repository. \n",
    "Does the student clearly and concisely introduce their code, including background information, and examples of working code? \n",
    "\t* *Excellent content*: A clear document which helps a new user understand the provided code (**4.0**)\n",
    "\t* *Good content*: A mostly useful document, but is disorganized, or otherwise requires some additional work to understand the code (**3.5**)\n",
    "\t* *Fair content*: Needs a great deal of work before it will be useful.(**3.0**)\n",
    "\t* *Poor content*: Either missing entirely, or doesn't add anything to the repo to help with a new user's entrance into the project. (**2.5**)\n"

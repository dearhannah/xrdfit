There are a class of programs called \"auto documentors\" that can read though code, organize the doc strings and output documentation for your software in a variety of formats (ex. pdf and html).  Probably the most famous of these is [Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/).  However, ```Sphinx``` is really intended for large software projects and is a little overkill for our class project.  For this project we plan to use ```pdoc``` which is a much easier to use program and fully compatible with ```Sphinx```. Meaning we can use ```pdoc``` to organize our documentation and easily upgrade to ```Sphinx``` if/when that is deemed necessary.  \n",

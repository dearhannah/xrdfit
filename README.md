# XRD analysis

Make a simulator for XRD data analysis

In "functions" directory, I have a file named unittest.ipynb where I saved my command used to do unit test.

I ran the make lint command.
I also used autopep8 to lint my functions.
However, probably because my functions are mainly not finished, the total score is still very low.
